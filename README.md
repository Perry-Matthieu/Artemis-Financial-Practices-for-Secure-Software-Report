# Artemis-Financial-Practices-for-Secure-Software-Report
Briefly summarize your client, Artemis Financial, and their software requirements. Who was the client? What issue did they want you to address?
A financial consulting company and they were seeking a solution to their data security conscerns.

What did you do very well when you found your client’s software security vulnerabilities? Why is it important to code securely? What value does software security add to a company’s overall wellbeing?
It is crucial to code securely because software vulnerabilities can lead to serious consequences such as data breaches, loss of confidential information, financial loss, and reputational damage. Code vulnerabilities can be exploited by attackers to gain unauthorized access to sensitive data, install malware, and carry out other malicious activities. Security breaches can be costly and may result in lawsuits, regulatory fines, loss of customers, and damage to the company's reputation. What I did well on this project is upon discovery of a vulnerability I immediately searched for a potential solution if one exists.

What part of the vulnerability assessment was challenging or helpful to you?
It took me a while to fully understand how to read and understand the data of the report. It was helpful to me once I understood how vulnerabilities were detected and where the report was referencing for vulnerability data.

How did you increase layers of security? In the future, what would you use to assess vulnerabilities and decide which mitigation techniques to use?
one added layer of security was the cryptographic hash algorithm for data verification, specifically the SHA-256 algorithm.

How did you make certain the code and software application were functional and secure? After refactoring the code, how did you check to see whether you introduced new vulnerabilities?
I re-reviewed my code to ensure it adhered to best practices, I used owasp dependency report, and reviewed the code with a third party.

What resources, tools, or coding practices did you use that might be helpful in future assignments or tasks?
Definately the vulnerability report. I also intend to continue to implement layers of security on future assignments to get better practice with implementation.

Employers sometimes ask for examples of work that you have successfully completed to show your skills, knowledge, and experience. What might you show future employers from this assignment?
My vulnerability report along with dependencies and how I now understand how to look for them. I would also show my implementation of SHA-256.
